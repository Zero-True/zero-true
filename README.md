### Usage 

Once the application is running, navigate to http://localhost:2613 and start creating and executing code cells. Click the "Run" button to execute code and visualize the output below the editor. 

#### Basic Example

```python
import zero_true as zt
my_slider = zt.Slider(id="my_slider")
```


#### More Complicated Example

```python

from zt_backend.models.components.slider import Slider 
from zt_backend.models.components.range_slider import RangeSlider
from zt_backend.models.components.button import Button 

slider = Slider(id='slider',row=0,column=0,label='First Slider')

if slider.value < 50:
    color = 'primary'
else:
    color = 'accent'
    
slider1 = RangeSlider(id='slider1',color=color,row=0,column=0, label= 'Second Slider')
slider2 = Slider(id='slider3',color=color,row=2,column=0,label='Third Slider')
slider4 = Slider(id='slider4',label = 'Fourth Slider')

button = Button(id='btn',text = 'Only Button')

```

And the resulting layout:
