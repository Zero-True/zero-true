App Mode 
========

App mode will show you what your application will look like when you share it. To run 
your application in appmode simply run 

.. code-block:: bash

   zero-true app 

In app mode users can see your code but can't edit it, so you don't have to worry about 
anyone running any untrusted code on your app.
