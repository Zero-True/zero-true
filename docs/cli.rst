CLI
===

Notebook
--------

To explore data and develop your notebook, go ahead and type 

.. code-block:: bash

   zero-true notebook 

Into your console. You will see a link in your console where you can start developing some
insights!

App Mode 
--------

App mode will show you what your application will look like when you share it. To run 
your application in appmode simply run 

.. code-block:: bash

   zero-true app 

In app mode users can see your code but can't edit it, so you don't have to worry about 
anyone running any untrusted code on your app. 

Publish Your Notebook 
---------------------

Publishing is not available to all users right now since we are still in beta. If you would like to be able 
to publish your app, please join our waitlist on our main website. 

.. code-block:: bash

   zero-true publish [api-key] [user-name] [project-name] [project-source]
