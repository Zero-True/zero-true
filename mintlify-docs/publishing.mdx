#### Publishing your notebook will create a project in our cloud from your notebook. Some important things to consider before publishing:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Cleanup Working Directory">
    Only the files that your notebook is based on should be included in the directory you are publishing from. This must include your notebook.ztnb and requirements.txt files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure requirements.txt is Accurate">
    Ensure that all dependencies and versions are specified in your requirements.txt before you publish.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Destination">
    Ensure that you are correctly publishing to either your own personal account (leaving team blank) or a team you are a member of. Projects published to your personal account will be public while those published to a team will be private with managable access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Project Title">
    Check that your project title does not already exist in your publish destination. If it does, that project will be overwritten by whatever you publish.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### You can publish your notebook in two ways:

Directly from your notebook:
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/publish_button.png" />
</Frame>

Using the CLI:

```bash
zero-true publish [api-key] [user-name] [project-name] [project-source] [team-name (optional)]
```
