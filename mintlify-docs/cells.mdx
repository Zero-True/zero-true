## Python

Write and execute Python code in cells like traditional notebooks. Packages without visual output are all available in the Python ecosystem are usable within Zero-True notebooks. For visualization and interactive components, checkout out our [component library](Components/Introduction).

## SQL

Our SQL cells are powered by duckdb. You can query csv, parquet, jsons, and other files as well as dataframes at blazingly fast speed. You can also reference Python variables in your SQL queries by using the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM {python_variable_name}
```

## Markdown

Like many other code notebooks, Zero-True allows you to interweave both Python and markdown so that you can easily document your findings and create a narrative using your analysis so that you can really tell the data story!

## Text

Zero-True also features a rich text editor so that users that are more comfortable writing text this way can contribute to notebooks.
