## Cell Toggles

<Info>Zero-True has a number of cell toggles that allow you to customize the behavior of cells and their visibility in app mode:</Info>


<Steps>
  <Step title="Non-Reactive (Python/SQL cells)">
    This is the only toggle that applies in both notebook and app mode. Marking a cell as non-reactive means that if you trigger a notebook run from a cell above and this cell is a child cell of any cell that is ran by that trigger, this cell will not be executed. This is useful for not triggering expensive queries or other operations when you don’t need them to be run but should be used with caution as it can lead to unexpected state as you continue to develop your notebook.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hide Cell (All cells)">
    This toggle will hide the cell in app mode. Although this cell will still be triggered by any parent cells, it will not be visible to a user in app mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hide Code (Python/SQL cells)">
    This toggle will hide the code in app mode. This is useful for creating a dashboard where sharing the code is unnecessary or confusing to your users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expand Code (Python/SQL cells)">
    If you are developing a dashboard where the code is a key part of the user experience, you can use this toggle to expand the code by default in app mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Show Table (SQL cells)">
    By default, the table component generated automatically by SQL cells in notebook mode is hidden in app mode. You can use this toggle to show the table in app mode but if the dataframe is large we recommend against this as it can decrease the performance of your app.
