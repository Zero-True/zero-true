You can get started with zero-true on your own computer for free! Our notebook is released under
a permissive open source license so you can use zero-true for whatever you'd like! 
Simply install zero-true using pip (we recommend installing in a fresh virtual environment).
Two options for managing virtual environments are [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) 
and [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), if you are not familiar with either we have included links
so you can get started.


## Using pip

```CLI
pip install zero-true
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that Zero-True is installed by running:

```CLI
pip show zero-true
```
