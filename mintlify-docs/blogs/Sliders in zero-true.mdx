## Creating a Slider

Creating a slider in zero-true is simple. Type:

```py
import zero_true as zt
slider=zt.Slider(id='slider')
```

Run the cell in your notebook, and watch the slider appear below.

## Slider Settings and Values

Sliders have a minimum, maximum, and step in zero-true. The default values are 0 and 100 but you can set them to whatever youâ€™d like. The slider value will return an integer or a float depending on what it is set to.

```py
print("The slider value divided by 2 is: "+str(slider.value/2.0))
```

## Slider Use Cases

Sliders can be used to capture any numeric input. Here is a more fleshed out example including filtering a dataframe: 

```py
import pandas as pd 
import zero_true as zt 

novels_df = pd.read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Science_Fiction:_The_100_Best_Novels&oldid=1091082777", match='The 100 Best Novels')[0]

#define a slider in zero-true to filter the data 
slider=zt.Slider(id='slider',min=1, max=100,label='Move the Slider to Filter the DataFrame')
#set the first value to 100 to keep all the novels in there
if not slider.value:
    slider.value=100

#display the dataframe with zero-true
zt.dataframe(id='df',df=novels_df[0:slider.value])
```
