title: 'State in zero-true'

No hidden state

One of the main features in zero-true is the fact that our notebook has no hidden state. This means that generally speaking if you rerun a cell in zero-true multiple times you get the same answer each time. The same is not true in most IPython notebooks. Consider the example illustrated below:

Cell 1:

```py
my_list = []
```

Cell 2:

```py
my_list.append(1)
print(my_list)
```

If you want to know what the output will be in zero-true the answer is easy: It’s ‘\[1\]’ every time. You can see in the gif below that in zero-true, no matter how many times I rerun cell 2, I get the same answer.

In current Ipython notebooks on the other hand you get a different answer each time (Google colab pictured below). Every time you rerun cell 2 you append to the same list and get a different answer.

There are cases where running the same cell in zero-true multiple times may not give you the same answer, like if you have a random number generator in your cell or you are writing and reading to external files and databases (essentially storing state outside of your notebook). However zero-true has explicit user state and global state objects you can reference.
