title: 'App Mode'

Zero-True has a built in app mode. You can show or hide cells or the code for cells 
in each individual cell (by default cells and code are shown),

## App Mode Preview

You can preview what your work would look like deployed as an application directly from your notebook. 
For users that have been moved off of our waitlist, you can also publish to a live URL directly from your notebook. 
When you publish an app users can interact with UI components and optionally view the code youâ€™ve written.

To run your notebook in app mode simply use the cli. Navigate to the directory with the notebook you want to display and use 
your cli to type

```
